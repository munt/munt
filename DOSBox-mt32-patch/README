                              Lacks the support for additional CPU / cores.

syncThread/midi_mt32.h      - version of the synth engine with synchronous rendering in a separate thread
                              Utilizes power of another CPU / core.
                              Adds latency about 1 ms and consumes more CPU time.

asyncThread/midi_mt32.h     - version of the synth engine with asynchronous rendering in a separate thread
                              Compared to the sync version, consumes significantly less CPU time.
                              Adds latency about 128 ms.
