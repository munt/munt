Next release:

	* Improved CoreAudio driver: CoreAudioStream no longer renders data in the GUI thread, a dedicated internal AudioQueue thread is used instead.
	* Added build option mt32emu-qt_WITH_DEBUG_WINCONSOLE. It controls whether a debugging console is shown on Windows.
	* Fixed a bug in LinearResampler that may cause incorrect output at beginning of each audio block.

2014-12-21:

	1.3.0 released.

	* Fixed incorrect handling of some rarely used control messages in ALSA MIDI driver.
	* Added support for using different sample rates in audio drivers using sample rate conversion.
	  It is still preferable to use default sample rate of MT-32 emulation engine and sample rate conversion
	  should only be used if a different sample rate is necessary (e.g. audio system doesn't support 32000 Hz) or deliberate.
	  For best performance, libsoxr is supported. Libsamplerate is also supported as it is widely available.
	  As a worst case, the integrated linear interpolator can be used (it's fast but the quality...).
	* Added a new combo box into the Synth Properties dialog that allows to choose analogue circuits emulation method.
	* Added CoreAudio driver for OS X. Portaudio is no longer required for OS X builds.
	* AlsaAudioDriver made more resistant to possible errors and trying to recover before giving up.
	* Incorporated MidiStreamParser class from libmt32emu. This fixes long standing issue with Windows MIDI driver
	  and MIDI-in port handler that prevented receiving SysEx fragments or multi-SysEx packets sent in a single buffer.
	  Windows MIDI driver also supports running status for short messages now. OSS MIDI and CoreMIDI drivers also improved by this.
	* AudioFileWriter now always produces .WAV files in little endian and .RAW files in big endian which corresponds to smf2wav behaviour.
	* Audio drivers for CoreAudio, ALSA and PulseAudio made compatible with big endian systems.
	* Improved command line in handling. Added new options "-profile" and "-max_sessions". Added short help regarding command line syntax.
	* Minor improvements in handling of synth profiles and ROM sets.
	* Added an option in synth properties to use alternative channel assignment automatically on opening a synth.

2014-06-09:

	1.2.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 1.4.0.
	* Added support for reverb model compatibility settings.
	* Fixed a few minor bugs related to reverb and output gains.
	* Added two convenience buttons in synth properties dialog to allow resetting MIDI channel assignment easily.
	* Improved build:
	  - added build option mt32emu-qt_WITH_ALSA_MIDI_DRIVER to control
	    whether to use ALSA MIDI driver (if enabled, ALSA MIDI sequencer
	    ABI is used to communicate with other applications, otherwise,
	    ALSA/OSS4 raw MIDI ports and OSS sequencer ABI are available);
	  - OSS MIDI driver no longer compiles if it isn't needed.
	* Fixed a bug in Windows MME audio driver introduced in version 1.1.0:
	  resetting the synth no longer cause stopping generation of audio output.
	* When ALSA MIDI driver is used, ALSA MIDI port being listened is now displayed in the main window title.
	* Fixed inconsistent ALSA MIDI port advertisement. ALSA MIDI driver now advertises the port
	  as SND_SEQ_PORT_TYPE_MIDI_GENERIC, SND_SEQ_PORT_TYPE_MIDI_MT32 and SND_SEQ_PORT_TYPE_MIDI_SYNTHESIZER.
	* When loading PulseAudio library dynamically, a library name with the major version number appended is tried first.
	  This allows PulseAudio to be loaded without installing the corresponding dev package, which only contains a versionless link
	  to the library shared object in major Linux/GNU distributions.

2013-09-21:

	1.1.0 released.

	* Updated for compatibility with new library v.1.3.0 API. Reworked rendering engine to make use of library internal MIDI event queue.
	* Removed sysex length limit set in the internal MIDI player and converter.
	* Added reverse stereo option to the synth properties dialog.
	* Improved ClockSync class for providing better timing accuracy yet being more robust.
	* Improved timing accuracy in the "advanced timing" mode.
	* Improved QtAudioDriver. Fixed sound dropouts which may occur when using GUI.
	* MIDI player now sends "Reset all controllers" MIDI events when it stops playing.
	* MIDI file converter now removes leading silence. MIDI conversion dialog now guesses PCM output file name if the user adds MIDI file first.
	* Eliminated application hangs on Windows when the application is closed enforcedly,
	  e.g. when the user closes the application console or shuts down the system.
	* Fixed deadlock which may happen when the user quickly pushes "Play" button in the MIDI player.
	* Improved ROM configuration. Added support for default ROM search path which is a directory "roms" located
	  in the current user home directory.
	* Reworked synth visualisation in order to make our LCD model close the hardware behaviour.
	  Added emulation of the "MIDI MESSAGE" led.
	* Fixed display of timbre names which contain null characters.
	* MIDI files can now be dropped to main window and MIDI file converter dialog.
	* Main window now restores its geometry when the application starts. Fixed main window geometry when synth details panel changes visibility.
	* Overall UI layout made more compact. Other UI improvements.
	* Improved build under POSIX environment.
	* ALSA driver can now open "sysdefault" device in order to easily bypass Pulse-ALSA plugin. It can also open "plug:hw" device in exclusive mode
	  to achieve minimal latency.
	* Code refactoring.
