------

Project was created with Xcode 3.2.6. To compile audio unit simply open project file 'mt32emu_osx_au.xcodeproj' with Xcode and start build.

Project need installed library from mt32emu:
1) Install MacPorts from www.macports.org
2) Install cmake tools via Macports: sudo port install cmake
3) svn checkout http://svn.github.com/munt/munt.git
4) cd munt.git/mt32emu
5) cmake -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;x86_64" .
6) make
7) sudo make install

Than build AU:
8) build debug or release of mt32emu_osx_au with xcode
9) it creates the release bundle in project folder below build/Release/ and it is called mt32emu_osx_au.component

Prepare AU for playing:
10) mt32emu_osx_au.component is an folder that is called bundle in OSX do to mt32emu_osx_au.component/Contens/Resources
11) copy the ROM's MT32_CONTROL.ROM and MT32_PCM.ROM to the Resources folder
12) copy the complete AU bundle to ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/ were other OSX programs that support AU looking for it

Check AU with 'auval' form Xcode (just for developers)
13) 'auval -a' lists all available Audio Units in OSX, our unit should be Found under 'aumu mt32 Munt'
14) 'auval -v aumu mt32 Munt' starts a few tests with our Audio Unit and hopefully there are all PASS

Example of using AU with 'AU Lab' and 'DOSBox':
15) open /Developer/Applications/Audio/AU Lab.app
16) select 'Stero Out' on the left
17) change 'Audio Input Device' to 'None' and press at 'Create Document'
18) In Menu select Edit -> Add Audio Unit Instrument...
19) change 'Instrument' to 'mt32emu_osx_au' and press 'OK'
20) if you got error '-3' than ROM'S count not found (see 9) )
21) in instrument window change from 'Generic View' on top right to 'Midi Editor' and select all 16 channels in 'Active Channels'
22) save your setups with File -> Save and in future you only have to click on this file
23) open DOSBox preference file under ~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox [actual version] Preferences and look for midi section 
24) change the settings in midi section to look like this:
[midi]
mpu401=uart
mididevice=coremidi
midiconfig=0
25) open DOSBox and start an DOS game that support MT32 sound or start an DOS midi player and play midi files containing MT32 informations
