2022-03-06:

	1.8.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.6.0.

2021-05-22:

	1.7.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.5.1.
	* Added support for partial bitwise ROM dumps (#58). Now, the synth can operate with
	  a pair of control ROM files and a pair of PCM ROM files, which are merged when needed.
	* Build: Replaced obsolete project files for MS Visual Studio with a CMake build script.

2021-01-17:

	1.6.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.4.2.
	* Added support for the two new synth properties NicePanning and NicePartialMixing introduced with mt32emu release 2.4.0.

2020-06-20:

	1.5.1 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.4.0.
	* Improved installation tools for compatibility with Windows 10 2004.

2017-12-25:

	1.5.0 released.

	* Fixed inappropriate implementation of MODM_GETDEVCAPS message that sometimes resulted in returning unreadable
	  driver name to the consumer MIDI application.
	* In Windows MIDI driver setup tool, implemented "repair" command. This command allows to restore the registry entry
	  used by driver which may be overwritten by Windows or some other application.
	* Reimplemented Windows MIDI driver setup tool for x64 platform. It no longer allows to install 32-bit and 64-bit
	  drivers separately since this way doesn't seem to be supported by Windows. Instead, the setup tool now detects
	  the platform it runs on and installs the drivers as appropriate. This should improve stability of the 32-bit driver
	  on 64-bit systems.
	* Added support for new synth profile option "Max Partials". It allows setting the maximum number of partials
	  playing simultaneously.

2017-07-29:

	1.4.0 released.

	* Added support for the synth profile setting "niceAmpRamp".
	* Implemented selection of output audio device using the setting "DefaultAudioDevice".
	  Note, that audio devices listed for WinMMAudio API (a.k.a. "waveout") are only guaranteed
	  to have identical device names and to be engaged. Other audio deivces for other audio APIs
	  may provide slightly different device names. In such a case (or if the selected device
	  is no longer available), the default wave mapper is used.

2017-04-09:

	1.3.0 released.

	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.1.0.
	* Added support for the synth profile setting "rendererType".

2016-10-22:

	1.2.0 released.

	* Fixed possible crashes when reloading settings to the internal synth upon MIDI port re-opening in some cases.
	* Updated mt32emu library to version 2.0.0.
	* Added support for mt32emu_qt settings version 2.

2015-01-11:

	1.1.1 released.

	* Fixed incorrect Analog emulation mode (and possibly samplerate) applied upon resetting the internal synth engine.

2014-12-21:

	1.1.0 released.

	* Fixed long standing issue with Windows MIDI driver that prevented receiving SysEx fragments or multi-SysEx packets
	  sent in a single buffer. Running status for short messages is also supported now.
	* Fixed unreliable synth close which may lead to crashes client MIDI applications when mt32emu_qt app is started and MIDI data is rerouted.

	1.0.0 released.

	* The driver doesn't rely on the deprecated DirectMusic interface any more.
	* Removed the deprecated in Vista driver control panel. Emulation settings can be controlled via mt32emu_qt,
	  the main synthesiser application, or directly via a registry editor.
	* Added support for an external synthesiser application. If the application is found running, incoming MIDI events
	  are directed to the external application for processing.
	* Added a dedicated driver installation helper to include to a setup package.
	* Both i386 and x86_64 platforms are supported.
