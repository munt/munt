//	CACFMachPort
//
//	This class wraps a CFMachPort.
//	
//	Note that when you create a CFMachPort object, CF will attach the run loop source for the the
//	Mach Port that handles Port Death notifications (aka the Invalidation Callback) to the current
//	thread's run loop. This is something over which there is no control, so be sure to create the
//	CFMachPort on the thread on which you want to handle Port Death notificaitons on.
