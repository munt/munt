//	This constructor is the general form:
//	-	If inMachPort is MACH_PORT_NULL, the CFMachPort will allocate the port and own the send and
//		receive rights. Otherwise, the caller owns the rights and is resposible for cleaning them
//		up.
//	-	If inCallBack is NULL, then received messages will just get swallowed by the CFMachPort.
//		This is useful if you are only using the CFMachPort to track port death (aka invalidation).
//	-	If inInvalidationCallBack is non-NULL, then it will be installed as the invalidation
//		callback on the CFMachPort.
