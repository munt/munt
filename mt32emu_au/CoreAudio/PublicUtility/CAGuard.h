//	This is your typical mutex with signalling implemented via pthreads.
//	Lock() will return true if and only if the guard is locked on that call.
//	A thread that already has the guard will receive 'false' if it locks it
//	again. Use of the stack-based CAGuard::Locker class is highly recommended
//	to properly manage the recursive nesting. The Wait calls with timeouts
//	will return true if and only if the timeout period expired. They will
//	return false if they receive notification any other way.
