//	AUOutputBL - Simple Buffer List wrapper targetted to use with retrieving AU output
// Works in one of two ways (both adjustable)... Can use it with NULL pointers, or allocate
// memory to receive the data in.

// Before using this with any call to AudioUnitRender, it needs to be Prepared
// as some calls to AudioUnitRender can reset the ABL

								// this version can throw if this is an allocted ABL and inNumFrames is > AllocatedFrames()
								// you can set the bool to true if you want a NULL buffer list even if allocated
								// inNumFrames must be a valid number (will throw if inNumFrames is 0)

								// if you want an empty buffer list, just call Prepare()
								// if you want to dispose previously allocted memory, pass in 0
								// then you either have an empty buffer list, or you can re-allocate
								// Memory is kept around if an Allocation request is less than what is currently allocated
